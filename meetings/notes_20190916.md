## progress Update

### [bootstrap daemon to boot a fresh node](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/issues/215)

PR in both zos and initramfs have been merged. 0-OS now boots from a generic image that only contains the bootstrap code that download all the rest of the daemons.

New issue regarding update upgraded has been open: https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/issues/248

### Implement gedis BCDB client

Most of the implementation is there. We need to now work on https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/issues/190 so we can actually get the client to the proper BCDB when booting 0-OS.

Still need to know how Farms are going to be identify in BCDB.

### Add ultimate routing for IPv4 in networkd

Most of the routing logic has been implemented. Only remaining work is implement the firewall rules.
