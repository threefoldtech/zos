# CPUBenchmark

### Overview

The `CPUBenchmark` task is designed to measure the performance of the CPU. it utilizes the [cpu-benchmark-simple](https://github.com/threefoldtech/cpu-benchmark-simple) tool and includes a zos stub to gather the number of workloads running on the node.

### Configuration

- Name: `cpu-benchmark`
- Schedule: 4 times a day
- Jitter: 10 min

### Details

- The benchmark simply runs a `CRC64` computation task, calculates the time spent in the computation and reports it in `seconds`.
- The computation is performed in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios.
- Lower time = better performance: for a single threaded benchmark, a lower execution time indicates better performance.
