# Upgrade module

## Zbus

Upgrade is an autonomous module and is not reachable over zbus.

## Home Directory
Upgraded does not have a home directory, although it can keep track of some files under /tmp. The reason that those files
are kept in a tmpfs filesystem, and not persisted on disk is that they are only needed during the runtime. On reboot new
files will be written. More on that later

## zinit unit

Upgrade module depends on network and flist module. This is because is requires network connection to check for new update and the flist module to download the upgrade flist on the node.


## Booting a new node
The base image for zos contains a very small subset of tools, plus the boot program. Standing alone, the image is not really useful. On boot and
after initial start of the system, the boot program kicks in and it does the following:
- Detect the boot flist that the node must use to fully start. The default is hard-coded into the image, but this can be overridden by the `flist=` kernel param. The `flist=` kernel param can get deprecated without a warning, since it's a development flag.
- The bootstrap, will then mount this flist using 0-fs, this of course requires a working connection to the internet. Hence bootstrap is configured to wait for the `internet` service.
- The flist information (name, and version) is saved under `/tmp/flist.name` and `/tmp/flist.info`.
- The bootstrap makes sure to copy all files in the flist to the proper locations under the system rootfs, this include `zinit` config files.
- Then zinit is asked to monitor new installed services, zinit takes care of those services and make sure they are properly working at all times.
- Bootstrap, umounts the flist, cleans up before it exits.
- Boot process continues.

## Runtime upgrade of a node
Once the node is up and running, upgraded takes over and it does the following:
- It loads the boot info files `/tmp/flist.name` and `/tmp/flist.info`
- If the `flist.name` file does **not** exist, `upgraded` will assume the node is booted with other means than an flist (for example overlay). In that case, upgraded will log this, and disable live upgrade of the node.
- If the `flist.name` file exists, the flist will be monitored on the `https://hub.grid.tf` for changes. Any change in the version will initiate a life upgrade routine.
- Once the flist change is detected, upgraded will mount the flist, make sure upgraded is running the latest version. If not, upgraded will update itself first before continuing.
- services that will need update will be gracefully stopped.
- `upgraded` will then make sure to update all services from the flist, and config files. and restart the services properly.
- services are started again after all binaries has been copied


## Technical

0-OS is designed to provide maximum uptime for its workload, rebooting a node should never be required to upgrade any of its component (except when we push a kernel upgrade).


### Flist layout

The files in the upgrade flist needs to be located in the filesystem tree at the same destination they would need to be in 0-OS. This allow the upgrade code to stays simple and only does a copy from the flist to the root filesystem of the node.

Booting a new node, or updating a node uses the same flist. Hence, a boot flist must container all required services for node operation.

Example:

0-OS filesystem:

```
/etc/zinit/identityd.yaml
/etc/zinit/networkd.yaml
/etc/zinit/contd.yaml
/etc/zinit/init/node-ready.sh
/etc/zinit/init
/etc/zinit/redis.yaml
/etc/zinit/storaged.yaml
