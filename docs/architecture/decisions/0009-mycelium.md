Date: 2024-01-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Support mycelium network for workloads

## Decision

Integrate mycelium in zos and allow workloads (vms) to have mycelium IPs

## Consequences

The feature is completely optional. Old clients should work normally without breakage. Optional Network and VM configuration can be used
to configure mycelium
