# 1. Mycelium

Date: 2024-05-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Support mycelium network for zdbs and zos host to get flists over mycelium

## Decision

Integrate mycelium in zos and allow zos host to have mycelium IPs, mount flists over mycelium, and support mycelium on zdbs

## Consequences

Using mycelium IP is optional. Old clients should work normally without breakage.
